Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste) your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.430599870611

Problem 3:
Running the program gave a NameError. Specifically, it said that name ‘linenum’ is not defined. This comes as a result of commenting out the line linenum = 0. Therefore line 40 does not recognize linenum to process linenum = linenum + 1.
If you commented out the line gc_count = 0 then the program would not be able to even being to process any of the information it reads.

Problem 4:
AT-content: 0.569400129389

Problem 5:
G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:
In every file except for test-small.fastq, the metric Sum count differs from the Total count and the seq length. The reason being not all of the sequence characters were G, C, A, or T. Throughout the program lie hidden N’s looking to contaminate the result. Placed there by a mad scientist bent on world domination through DNA manipulation no doubt.

Problem 7:
AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:
GC Classification: Moderate gc content

Collaboration:
The only person who helped me was Paul Pham.

Reflection:
I learned that notepad sucks for one thing. I also learned that computing DNA is weird because it takes a very large amount of data and gives a very simple answer. However I enjoyed these last two homework styles. It was actually fun to make this program and know what I’m doing. And at the end when I look at the large program I created, it’s very satisfying.
