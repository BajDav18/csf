Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste) your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:
Running the program gave a NameError. Specifically, it said that name ‘linenum’ is not defined. This comes as a result of commenting out the line linenum = 0. Therefore line 40 does not recognize linenum to process linenum = linenum + 1.
If you commented out the line gc_count = 0 then the program would not be able to even being to process any of the information it reads.

Problem 4:
AT-content: 0.568993851852

Collaboration:
The only person who helped me was Paul Pham.

Reflection:
I learned that notepad sucks for one thing. I also learned that computing DNA is weird because it takes a very large amount of data and give a very simple answer.
